"GRNZ is a hands-on project where I delved into the world of web development, 
honing my skills in using Bootstrap to create a seamless integration of HTML and CSS.
 Throughout the project, I focused on mastering the art of structuring content with divs, 
 implementing responsive design principles, and efficiently linking HTML files. 
 The journey involved a deep dive into Bootstrap components, providing a solid foundation
  for creating modern and visually 
appealing web interfaces.
